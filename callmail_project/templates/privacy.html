Our general refund policy is to oblige refund requests that are made within 14 days of   purchase in which no actual consumption of the product or the service has been   initiated.  However, the total value of the refund which we make is dependent upon two factors:  The level of its usage - we will not allow our refund policy to be abused and taken   advantage of.  The involvement of a third party supplier - If the product/service has involved a third   party supplier, our ability to provide a refund depends on whether payment has been   made to the third party and their refund policies.2. The involvement of a third party   supplier - If the product/service has involved a third party supplier, our ability to provide   a refund depends on whether payment has been made to the third party and their   refund policies.  Actual consumption of the service or product has occurred and taken place, rendering   an actual refund of the virtual product meaningless.  If the customer feels that the service was not delivered as per their expectations then   CALLNMAIL&nbsp;&nbsp; is happy to consider a possible full or partial refund (at CALLNMAIL's   discretion) on a case by case basis.  All disputes and purchase inquiries, along with their CALLNMAIL&nbsp; ID, invoice number and   detailed description of a customer&rsquo;s feedback or problems with the purchased service   and product must be sent to refunds@CALLNMAIL&nbsp;&nbsp; for possible refund consideration.  We may also issue a refund for any payment that we do not wish to accept. You   understand that the returning of monetary funds, unless otherwise agreed, will be made   through the same mechanism through which they were initially accepted.  Please contact us at:&nbsp; contact@Callnmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp; with any questions regarding this   Agreement.</p>
